# PoolParty Bounty Tasks

To earn rewards on the PoolParty testnet, submit evidence of having completed the following tasks. The goal is stress test the Stride core appchain and module logic. 

**Thoughtful, clear submissions will be rewarded ***far*** more than low-effort submissions, which will receive minimal rewards.**  

### Disclaimers
1. We will NOT verify your submission is valid until the incentivized testnet has finished.
2. The points listed in the task are the max you can earn for completing the task with high quality. Most submissions will earn fewer points for low quality, or no points if they violate the rules.
2. You will be asked to prove you own the address associated with the account that completed the task
3. You will be asked for several other verifications to prevent sybil attacks. 

## How To Submit A Task
Please submit evidence you've completed a task using the google form, using your best judgement to determine what constitutes proof you've completed the task (links to transactions/accounts and writeups are best; screenshots are acceptable but not ideal, other forms of evidence are unlikely to earn you rewards).
